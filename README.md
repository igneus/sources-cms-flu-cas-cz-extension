# Browser Extension for the Sources at "Centrum Medievistických Studií"

Firefox extension enhancing https://sources.cms.flu.cas.cz/src/
with keyboard navigation.
(Works only on the book page view.)

* `left arrow key` - go to the previous page
* `right arrow key` - go to the next page

For now this extension has only been published as source on Github.
Created mainly for myself as a productivity hack.
